# Solutions for Hyndman's Exercises (Forecasting: Principles and Practice - 3rd Edition)

In this repository you will find my solutions to the exercises at the end of each chapter in Hyndman's [awesome book on Forecasting](https://otexts.com/fpp3/).

I couldn't find official solutions, so I cannot guarantee that my solutions are correct. If some solutions are not correct, or solution demands more explanation, feel free to contact me or to fork the repo with amended solutions.
